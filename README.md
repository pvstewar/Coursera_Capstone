# Purpose

I created this project for an IBM data science capstone course where we were asked to create a useful data science project with python on and using the Four Square venue application's open data. The project was intended to visualize the geographic distribution of grocery stores in the city of Indianapolis, Indiana.

# Contents

1. Grocery Store Availability Report - A PDF file detailing the findings of my research including visualization of the data and maps of store availability. (This should be a 16 page document but github may cut it short so a copy is available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10T27RcXUUXuTZwvQNVT29vF77NYBtE-GH2cSGC3oD3o/edit?usp=sharing )
2. Grocery Store Data Project - My python project in a Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Indianapolis Zip Codes - CSV file for the zip codes in Indainapolis.
